# CY-Product_Website

This repository utilizes HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript to create what an interactive website may appear or behave like across browser and mobile views. Using API calls, a product page loads, and pages adjust depending on size of screen. Other pages include a temperature converter for vacationers, a sale countdown page, and a contact form.

Unofficial features --

- [x] Responsive Design {Best Practice} [All Pages]

- [x] Integrate a third-party API into project. {REQ}

- [x] Utilized Local and Session Storage for name and email fields on the contact form




## Guideline Features: 

- [x] Convert user input between two formats and display the result. (e.g. Fahrenheit to Celcius, kilograms to pounds, etc) {Intermediate} [Home]

- [x] Calculate and display data based on an external factor (ex: get the current date, and display how many days remaining until some event) {Intermediate} [Promo]

- [x] Retrieve data from a third-party API and use it to display something within your app. {Easy} [https://fakestoreapi.com/] [Products]

- [] Create a node.js web server using a modern framework such as Express.js or Fastify.  Serve at least one route that your app uses (must serve more than just the index.html file). {OPTIONAL - ATTEMPTED} {Easy/Intermediate} (Original attempt: https://github.com/JodieMullins/CY-WebDev)
